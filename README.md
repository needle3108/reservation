It`s my first project using Spring boot and the goal is to build a web application, wchich will allow for registered users to make a reservation for airplane`s tickets.
I`m using PostgreSQL database, wchich holds information about users in user table, also holds planes information in plane table and of course reservations information.
For now there are register and login features implementations.
