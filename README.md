It`s my first project using Spring boot and the goal is to build a web application, wchich will allow for registered users to make a reservation for airplane`s tickets.
I`m using PostgreSQL database, wchich holds information about users, airplanes, airports, flights and reservations.
Only registered users can book ticket for flight.
New airplanes, airports and flight are added by admin.
All features has been implemented, what is left to do is make website prettier :)
